                If you are here then you might be know about me. As I'm from middle class family I have been always
                seeking
                for
                money, though I'm already earing but that is not enough to fullfill my dreams. So, I decided to be a
                web-developer so that I can make money from this. I don't know is it a bad idea or good but I won't stop
                untill
                I got what I want. As I said I'm dedicated about it so, if you think you need me than just poke me
                anywhere.
            </P>
