            <P>
                If you are here then you might be know about me. As I'm from middle class family I have been always
                seeking
                for
                money, though I'm already earing but that is not enough to fullfill my dreams. So, I decided to be a
                web-developer so that I can make money from this. I don't know is it a bad or good idea but I won't stop
                untill
                I got what I want. As I said I'm dedicated about it so, if you think you need me than just poke me
                anywhere and keep me in your prayer.
            </P>

                    I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
                    Vue
                    JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.

                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
